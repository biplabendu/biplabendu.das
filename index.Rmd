I am a doctoral student in the [Department of Biology](http://sciences.ucf.edu/biology/) at the University of Central Florida.
I work with [Dr. Charissa de Bekker](http://sciences.ucf.edu/biology/debekkerlab/) who has been the pioneer in setting up protocols for successfully transferring the behavioral manipulating fungus into the ants in laboratory conditions.

Coming up soon.
